                    <h2>ENTRY#1: FAVORITE CMSC SUBJECT SO FAR AND WHY</h2>
                    <h3>CMSC Courses Already Taken: 12, 56, 21, 57, 22, 123, 130, 150</h3>
                    <p>
                        I have a lot of favorite CMSC subjects but if I were to choose one, I think it would be 130 which I took last semester.
                        I would say that last semester was really stressful since we had to learn 3 programming languages at the same time. 130,
                        which didn't require any programming exercises, easily became one of my favorites since I felt like I was able to rest
                        and destress while doing pen-and-paper and not having to code anything. I would also pick CMSC 22 since I really enjoyed
                        learning Java and OOP concepts. If I had more time to study for the course without too much pressure, that subject would
                        probably be my most favorite.

                    <h2>ENTRY#2: FAVORITE GE SO FAR AND WHY</h2>
                    <h3>GE Courses Already Taken: ETHICS 1, STS 1, ARTS 1, HIST 1, COMM 10</h3>
                    <p>
                        Out of all the GE courses I've taken, I probably liked ARTS 1 the most. I took it in the 2nd semester of my first year in UP
                        That was when the Taal Volcano eruption and the pandemic made us stop in the middle of everything. Though I was not able to finish
                        that course, I've always been interested in art and liked to dabble with drawing and painting sometimes (though I've never been much good at it).
                        Learning some of the history and basics of art from our professor who is also an artist, Sir Jualim Vela, had me really excited about 
                        the course. We were supposed to take workshop classes with him to help us with the basics of sketching and unfortunately, we never got to finish them.
                        Still, ARTS 1 still became my favorite GE so far.

                    <h2>ENTRY#3: FAVORITE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE SO FAR AND WHY</h2>
                    <h3>Programming Languages I've Learned: Python, C, Java, R</h3>
                    <p>
                        I think I liked Java the most so far. I've learned how to use Java last semester and I was able to enjoy learning how to program in an
                        object-oriented manner. I also had fun creating one of the final tasks we were supposed to do which was a game. The OOP concepts, though new,
                        were easier for me to understand. I also like it as a high-level language since I can read and understand it easily, though lower-level
                        languages also have an appeal in the challenges they present (but not so much appealing when I'm having trouble with them).
